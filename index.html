        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year student of University of California, Riverside with a major in Pre-Business, expecting to concentrate on accounting in two years after I meet all my requirements. As a prospective first year, I am finding many opportunities in my university to gain valuable experience which can help me succeed in my career after graduation. I've participated in numerous classes related to my major and coincide well, from microeconomics to intro to business. I hope to gain enough experience to be able to manage in my position as an accountant, earning my CPA and finding a capable job. In turn, this would provide me ample time to apply to a law school, where I plan to become a tax lawyer. Should law school not work out, I can simple backtrack to being an accountant for a business.<br><br>

        I do not have much work experience, but have been able to intern at a law firm during my junior year of high school. My internship was at Law Offices of James Wang, a law firm that specializes in motor vehicle injury and located in the City of Industry. During my internship, I was tasked to record time stamps of fellow employees, archive emails of clients from up to 4 years ago, and write out demands for the firm to send to insurance companies. I was able to gauge into the typical environment of a law firm during my time there, and see how the lawyers speak with their clients regarding their case. The experience overall solidified my decision to become a lawyer after graduating UCR. I am currently looking for other job opportunities which will help me become a capable accountant, though without much luck due to how busy I am. I hope to gain more hands-on experience with accounting through job opportunities and internships so I may be better suited to accomplish my job.<br><br>

        During my studies at UCR, I decided to join a number of organizations within my school to help network and gain more experience. The most notable organizations I joined were Phi Alpha Delta and Future Business Leaders of America - PBL. I had previously joined my high school's FBLA club in an effort to find my specialty in the business world. The experience was pleasant enough that I wanted to continue my participation in the club through their PBL division. As for Phi Alpha Delta, I only learnt of its appearence in UCR through my peer advisor, and I subsequently joined the club after meeting the president by chance. Both organizations related to my interests, both as an accountant and as a future lawyer. They have allowed me to realize my goals in the coming years, as well as provide me with the best opportunity to gain experience and a greater understanding of what my career asks of me. Going forward, I hope to expand my involvement within these organizations so I may be able to improve myself. The connections I have made in both organizations serve to enlighten me more of the world beyond university.
